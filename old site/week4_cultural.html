						<p>To the average person not born in the last few decades, it might seem as if the tech industry sprang up overnight. Computers had long been something people had been simply aware of; you knew they existed, you knew they were important, and you vaguely knew what they were capable of, but they were essentially exotic objects. 'Due to advances in computing technology' has already become a cliche phrase, but it accurately describes how computers made their way from a select few organizations seemingly into every man, woman, and child's pocket in the country. For many, computers have rendered things such as address books, mail, and document storage obsolete and, in doing so, has opened up a whole new set of dangers to go along with the benefits. </br></br>

						Some of the biggest news stories over the past few years, even the past few months or weeks, really, have been about security vulnerabilities present in technology. The two major categories into which the security issues fall are potential abuse of power by authorities, and vulnerability of personal information from fellow citizens. </br></br>

						While issues about government (be it federal, state, or local) intrusion into the lives of innocent citizens is an issue as old as time, these concerns have become increasingly apparent since the 1950's. Just as technology has made people's lives easier and more convinient, the same systems and advancements, be it telephone wire, wireless signal-spoofing, or direct access to private servers, have done the same for government information gathering. These issues came to a head in the summer of 2013 with the Edward Snowden's revelations about the extent the NSA collects data on the average citizen, but this topic has been thoroughly covered it seems moot to focus on it too deeply. What's important, ultimately, is the ease at which the government can access personal information of citizens without a warrant, both in mass collections of user data and in targeting of specific data in private organizations. </br></br>

						As old a story as concern over abuse of power by authorities is concern over the unwanted intrusion of other people into our lives. And, unfortunately, technology has made theft easier as well. A big recent news story has been about celebrities whose nude photos were stolen from supposedly secure servers at Apple; while this issue may seem trivial in comparison to the previous issue, it speaks to a far bigger issue: that people are very comfortable with having personal information stored digitally, but too little is being done to actually make sure the information is being secured. 

						Ultimately, the only clear way to deal with both of these issues is with information encryption - both with strong encryption algorithms and with wider adoption of encryption technology on both a business and personal level. Adding encryption to even a small fraction of files being searched by the government would make searching through them prohibitively expesnive and time consuming. A private company, priding itself on user-friendliness and security, has a real responsibility to its customers to make sure their data is safe.
