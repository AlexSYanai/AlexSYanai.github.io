						<p>Ruby is a language that is fairly accessible to beginners; going hand-in-hand with this, Ruby also has an active online community that helps everyone from beginners to pros. Sites such as Stackoverflow are frequented by people of all skills looking to help or keep their skills sharp, but there's a big caveat that people realize pretty quickly: they're pretty confusing.<br><br>

						Sifting through already answered questions gets frustrating pretty quickly, so after you've ascertained that you can't find an existing answer, the best thing to do is write your own! Be it on a public site or a private community (such as the DBC Google+ group), there are a number of things to consider when writing out your question.<br><br>

						It seems obvious, but the first thing you should be sure to include is what language you're using. While context usually makes it obvious what is being used, there are common problems that one might encounter in a number of languages, and more importantly, it's best not to leave any room for ambiguity. Something else to consider is what code you can include; if the problem is a simple question of syntax, including the code you wrote helps tremendously, as others can run it themselves to see the error raised. In addition to any code, make sure to explain the problem in detail, while also keeping it concise; a tradeoff between the 2 is important, as a vague question might not be answerable at all, yet a wall of text might cause people to skip over it - their time is just as valuable as yours. Finally, be sure to both review your question and be present to answer any replies - don't post a question and just forget about it.<br><br>

						I haven't asked a question in the DBC Google+ group or any public forum, but I've asked plenty of questions to people through pairing seesions and email, almost always with great results. One of the first questions I asked was about Git - specifically how to push changes. I'd been pushing my changes by being in the correct directory and typing 'git push', something that worked, but always generated a huge warning message. I figured that this wasn't what I was supposed to do, but we were several weeks into Phase 0 and, since it worked, I just got used to it. I was chatting with a member of my cohort after finishing a challenge during a pairing session and the subject of Git came up, so I decided to ask him the question - framing it as 'how do you [emphasis] push changes? I think I've been doing it incorrectly.' Not only did he tell me the correct answer (which, incidentally, I had long suspected), but he was able to teach me an interesting command, 'git add -A', that I've since used a number of times. While this may seem like a trivial example, it illustrates how useful and productive asking questions can be, and I hope it encourages people to ask questions sooner rather than later.<br><br>
