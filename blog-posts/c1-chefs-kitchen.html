					<h2>Chef's Kitchen: The DBC Culture</h2>

						<p>After about 15 minutes of watching Shereef's video, I knew that it was a perfect way to end the first week of DBC, even if I'm writing this blog post with a deadline looming and no time to spare to mull over new information. Or maybe even because of this.<br><br>

						Shereef addressed 2 potential sources of anxiety for new DBC students: that some students might think they're too advanced walking into DBC, while others might believe that they are far behind everyone else. Its easy for me to talk about the latter; seeing others post in the Google+ group, its easy to get the feeling that I'm a fraud, convincing myself that I'm comfortable with a concept when I'm not; sketching out a template, only to see an awful product; spending hours working on something, only to have it not turn out right. What's not as easy is recognizing that others' views of my place in DBC could be a mix of the two. I can think of more than a few people who question why I would enter a program like DBC - "You already have a degree in a subject, you already had a job" or "You were never the best at math, how could you be good at programming?" But, on the other hand, enough people who know me consider me some sort of wizard with computers - "You know so much, I'm sure this will be nothing for you."<br><br>

						Both of these points are wrong. I know I can learn web development, but I also know that this is going to be far from easy, and this feeling comes with its own anxiety that people don't really consider. What struck me the most in Shereef's comments, though, was that this is a good thing. People always try and relieve anxiety; after all, why would you want someone you care about to feel anxious about something? But I'm excited to be anxious about something: it means I'm approaching a challenge. I'm sure there are people right now who are far more skilled than I am at the beginning, and I'm sure there are people who know less, but in the wide-view, we're all starting in the same place. We're all in it together<br><br>

						To add to this point, about 40 minutes(?) into the video, Shereef began talking about pairing, and the social aspect of working at a company and the interpersonal skills needed to succeed after you actually get a job. I really like the partnership aspect of the DBC culture and think that its incredibly valuable alongside the technical education. While a motivated person can figure something out on their own given sufficient time, its far easier and more efficient to tackle to problem with someone else - talk it through, come up with strategies, or just plain ask how to do something. Even in places like colleges, often considered the height of socialization, learning and class time can feel isolating, and true collaboration can be sparse. I've already had a great time working with my accountability group, and I can't wait to get onsite and meet everyone!
