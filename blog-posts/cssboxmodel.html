						<p>When first starting to learn CSS, its easy to become convinced that it is an easy concept. While adding a background color or changing a font are not too challenging, when it's time to start positioning elements, things start to go downhill. Positioning the elements on a page (in other words, getting the content of your site to look the way you want it to) can quickly become frustrating. A major source of confusion with regard to positioning elements is the differences between margin, border, and padding, and how each will affect the content within a 'div'.<br><br>

						Think of a div as a box containing the content you wish to present - to simplify things, we'll assume the content is a paragraph of text.<br>

						<div class="content_image"><img src="../imgs/margin.png"><img src="../imgs/margin_syntax.png"></div><br>

						Probably the easiest of the three to understand is the margin: a margin is simply the area around the outside of the div. When a margin is added, it clears the area surrounding the div of all other elements or content. Margins can be tricky since, by their very nature, they don't have a background color, and its easy to lose track of how far a margin extends. Like, borders and padding, you can add a margin to any or all of the 4 sides of a div. Since a margin is external, adding one can always be uses to position the entire div. Need to move your div a bit to the right? Add a small margin on the left.<br><br>

						<div class="content_image"><img src="../imgs/padding.png"><img src="../imgs/padding_syntax.png"></div><br>

						While margins are familiar to most people from their elementary school days, a concept that's less familiar to many is padding. Padding adds space around the content of a div - the paragraph of text, in our example, will retain its dimensions and layout, but and area will be cleared between it and the div surrounding it. Its important to note that, since padding does not affect the content of the div, adding it causes the div's dimensions to increase, something that must be taken into account when laying out the proportions of a page. Padding is clear on its own, it is affected by the styles applied with the div; if our paragraph, for instance, had a red background then our padding would be red as well.<br><br>

						<div class="content_image"><img src="../imgs/border.png"><img src="../imgs/border_syntax.png"></div><br>

						Finally, the last concept is a relatively familiar one: border. I saved the border for last because, with regards to CSS, its easiest to describe as simply the area between the margin and the padding. Just like the borders you're probably picturing CSS borders are often thin (1-2 pixels wide) and are generally used to accent or demarcate the content within the div. Borders are technically on the outside of a div, although you can consider them as adding to the dimensions of a div when applied. When adding a border, its important to set a color as well as a thickness.<br><br>

						Overall, understanding the differences between margin, border, and padding is not too difficult, but you should be wary of how actually implementing them will affect your design. Using Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shit+I on Windows or Cmd+Shift+I) can help illustrate the idea behind the Box Model. The easiest way to fully understand these three concepts is to practice them on their own - being unfamiliar with how they act can add a lot of time to your project.
