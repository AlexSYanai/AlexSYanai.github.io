						<p>After taking the Gregoric Thinking Style quiz, I found out that I am an Abstract Sequential thinker. Having a preference for abstract over concrete thinking means that I prefer thinking about things in a way that emphasizes the unseen aspects of a problem, as opposed to what is immediately tangible. A preference for sequential over random thinking means that I prefer to think linearly and logically, following a specific path that can be clearly stated rather than jumping back and forth between different parts of a problem.<br><br>

						Taking this quiz and researching the result was actually very beneficial to me, especially since it forced me to think about how I actually approach learning, rather than how I think (or would like to think) that I do. I may want to, for instance, think that I can sit down and only focus on the task in front of me, but in reality, this is not how I do things, and not how I have done things in the past. This has been challenging for me in Phase 0 since my mind and interests tend to wander when reading about a topic; while I make deadlines when I know they are set, if given no time limit for specific tasks, I may spend significant time researching tangentially related, or even unrelated, topics, rather than accomplishing what I sat down to accomplish.  My independent research leads to me learning many amazing and interesting things about a subject that may not help me solve any immediate short-term problem, which ultimately makes tasks take longer than they should. <br><br>

						I don't view my thinking style as something that should or needs to be overcome - I think allowing my mind to wander is a good thing and I've learned too many incredible things in my own research to want to change in totality. The amount of extra time doing these things adds does present an issue, and this can be overcome by setting definite time tables, having externally or internally set deadlines for specific tasks. Another positive step I can take is to make lists of unrelated subjects that interest me to learn about when I have more free time. Something I'm happy about with regards to my thinking style is that it helps increase my growth mindset. I definitely have fixed-mindset tendencies, but being interested in and open to new ideas is something a boon to the further development of a growth-mindset.
