						<p>Everybody has times in their life when they're the proudest, the happiest, and the most satisfied. When writing out this sentence, the thing that strikes me is that there's no reason that all of these feelings had to happen concurrently. After all, it's virtually cliche that a person's proudest moment might be their hardest, or they might be most satisfied after making a hard decision when miserable. Still, there is overlap, of course, and it's hard to ignore my most important values when thinking about those times.<br><br>

						The first value very important to me is independence. While at it's worst, independence can lead to isolation or stubborness, at it's best, it brings a novelty of thought and confidence in facing the unkown. For instance, when deciding to dramatically switch careers, I was happy, proud, and satisfied, even though many thought and said that I was making a huge mistake. Being less independent might have meant me backing off from the decision, or never making it to begin with.<br><br>

						The second value that's important to me is introspection. I value introspection greatly, and it's one of the values I think people would benefit greatly from cultivating further. It's very easy to say and know what you want and to, subsequently, stay on the course forever, never seriously questioning what you're doing. People spend their lives doing things as planned and ultimately not being happy/satisfied in the end, and more importantly never really understanding why they are that way. There are innumerable reasons why this may be the case for any given person, but not truly looking into it means they'll never really know.<br><br>

						These two values help combat stereotype threat in pretty clear ways. An independent person puts far less stock in the opinions of the group and society on the whole, both of these being the ultimate cause of stereotype threat. An indpendent person is a lot less likely to treat another as the member of a group, rather than as an individual. Introspection is just as important to negating stereotype threat. If independence makes a person less likely to think something, introspection helps people deal with beliefs that already exist. Just as important as not developing false beliefs is being able to negate them for yourself - this applies to both negative thoughts about yourself and negative thoughts about others.<br><br>

						I've talked to a lot of people about their life and future plans over the past couple of years, mostly friends from college, and applying these 2 values seem to help a lot. People often encounter many dissenting voices, and somebody able to provide impartial advice, almost playing devil's advocate against the popular opinion, and making them a source of support.</p>
