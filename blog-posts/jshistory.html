						<p>If you've visited any other website today, chances are you came into contact with Javascript - a term often familiar to those without any experience with programming. People who remember the Internet of the 90s often associate it with endless, annoying pop-up boxes, but we've come a long way since then. <br><br>

						Javascript (not to be confused with Java, the name of an unrelated programming language you've probably seen around) was originally developed for Netscape Navigator, and it was quickly adopted by Microsoft for Internet Explorer as well. Javascript's rapid spread was largely because, at its inception, it was the only real option for those wishing to run a program in a browser; this early spread is a big part of why Javascript is popular today: everyone used it because it filled a need and eventually everyone started using because it's what everyone supported. Today, every major browser supports Javascript - something invaluable to web developers. <br><br>

						Don't get the wrong idea about Javascript: there are plenty of things that make Javascript  great! First off, since Javascript is so widely used, there is a truly staggering amount of community support and resources available free online. The Javascript libraries available mean that someone looking to add something to a web page doesn't have to start from scratch. Why waste time reinventing the wheel? <br><br>

						Javascript runs in your web browser - it doesn't need to be, essentially, "sent off" to a server to be processed. What does this mean to you? Speed. Running a program in the browser means a page can be altered without having to reload a page. This also means that writing and testing code can be done without uploading code to a server and running it from there. Remember saving time? <br><br>

						For all of its strengths, Javascript does have some downsides. Whether due to real or imagined flaws, many professionals held a bias against Javascript early on, and the poor reputation has persisted this day. One legitimate issue with Javascript is security; since Javascript runs in browsers, it has been used maliciously to obtain user data and infect computers without their knowledge. Javascript also, while supported across most browsers, may not run as intended on older versions of browsers. Compatibility with older browsers is something that developers must account for in designing their pages.</p>
