						<p>In an ideal world, a person's ability to learn concepts and skills and advance through the world would be based solely on their ability and diligence; while this seems like a logical and sensible statement, it is, in many ways, far from how things actually work.<br><br>

						While numerous bodies of work and even whole fields of study have been generated on the effects of social perception and stereotyping over the past half century, many people are largely oblivious of them. One of the most widely studied subjects on the effects of socialization on achievment (and one of the most studied subjects in the whole field of social psychology) is stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is the situational feeling of anxiety and subsequent decrease in performance and ability that occurs in people who feel they may be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes held by society towards their social group. While the exact mechanism of action is debated, numerous studies over the past few decades have demonstrated stereotype threat, and the real-world application of the concept are far-reaching.<br><br>

						Minorities, long discriminated against in the US, are at risk of decreased performance in areas such as academic testing, largely due  to the already existing expectation that they will perform worse than whites. Women can experience stereotype threat when in or attempting to enter traditionally male-dominated fields (mathematics, engineering etc.) due to a societal view of gender roles and specific careers being 'men's work.' While these two examples are the most studied (and most pervasive), most people end up experiencing stereotype threat in some way, as virtually everybody has at least one group identity, and all identities come with their own stereotypes.<br><br>

						Regardless of the group or person experiencing sterotype threat, the effects are real and detrimental, and the most important thing that people can do to combat it is to be conscious of it. It's very easy to fall back on stereotypes when you're not conscious of your proclivity to do so, and the best thing any person can do is to remind themselves that the people they are dealing with are individuals. This may seem obvious, but everyone's actions when dealing with others, in even a small way, serve to shape their views of how other perceive them; just like a small, negative statement can hurt someone and reinforce stereotypes, a small positive statement or action can have the exact opposite effect.</p>
