						<p>Hello, and welcome to the inaugural post of my blog! In this post, I'll be analyzing three of my favorite websites - specifically user experience and general design. The websites I've chosen for this post are Imgur, Fark, and The Onion; while the first two are content aggregators, Imgur for pictures and Fark for news stories, the third, The Onion, is a news source parodying the very content to which the first two often direct their traffic. <br> <br>
						<h2>Imgur</h2>
						Do you want to stay up to date with the viral content of the minute? Do you not want to do a lot of reading? Imgur is the place for you.
						<br>
						<br>
						The first thing you'll see upon visiting Imgur is a grid of pictures against a black background: this is Imgur's 'front page' (of its gallery), and it displays the most popular content of the day. Imgur follows a simple black and lime-green color scheme - key, in order to make the pictures the focus of the site. Clicking on a picture enlarges it and brings up a [friendlier-than-you-usually-find-on-the-Internet] comments section, and scrolling through images is as simple as hitting left or right on your keyboard.
						<br>
						<br>
						The front page can be configured to list pictures in a number of different ways: highest  scoring, based on a community rating ('upvote') system, popularity, based on number of image views, and most viral, an Imgur algorithm somewhat opaque to the community. Users can also browse images submitted directly to Imgur's gallery, though true Imgurians know this content rarely goes viral.
						<br>
						<br>
						Imgur was originally set up as an imaging hosting site for Reddit, so when something becomes popular there, it will inevitably also surface on Imgur's front page. This cross listing leads to an interesting dynamic on Imgur; while users have some degree of control over how pictures are organized on Imgur, there is far less control over what actually ends up there.
						<br>
						<br>
						<h2>Fark</h2>
						I've been going to Fark since I was 13 years old (in 2003), so I can faithfully say that it was the first new-aggregator I regularly visited - unless you count the AOL homepage!
						<br>
						<br>
						Fark is the classic example of a news aggregator; the homepage is simply a list of headlines linking to outside news sources. To the right of the headlines is the name or logo of the linked site and the category of the link, while to the right is the Fark comments section, as represented by a number indicating the number of comments within. Fark's local is its own name, in a simple blue-gray to white gradient color-scheme.  The site itself has a grey background, with the colors grey, white, and blue predominant throughout. Fark has changed design several times over the past decade and a half, but its overall design is structurally similar. 
						<br>
						<br>
						Fark's links are not automatically aggregated - instead, the links are user-submitted and moderator-approved, with the Fark headlines written jokingly by the submitter. The submitter also chooses the link tag or category, and users can browse specific categories via tabs at the top of the site.
						<h2>The Onion</h2>
						Everybody's favorite satirical news source. The Onion's homepage looks very similar to what a newspaper's home page generally looks like: white background, black text, and bold headlines above short article leads. The Onion's layout is convincing enough that it often makes unfamiliar readers believe it is an actual new source - something that, given the content, is probably pretty shocking for them.
						<br>
						<br>
						The first stories at the top of the page are the newest or 'breaking news' stories; the site has a number of sections at the bottom of the page as well, just as any newspaper would: In The News, Local, Business, Sports, and Commentary are all sections mimicking those found in real newspapers, although even the commentaries, ostensibly written as opinion pieces, are the work of comedy writers. A somewhat confusing aspect of the website, logistically, is that stories featured at the top are also categorized, meaning that a story can be linked twice on the same page, with both links often being in close proximity to one another. Knowing the site, this seeming imperfection could simply be another inscrutable joke at the expense of the audience.</p>
