						<p>People don't think of programming as a social career; after all, decades of movies and TV shows depicting stereotypically-nerdy and isolated programmers performing esoteric tasks in dimly lit rooms has conditioned people to think of the group as lacking in social skills. Pairing has been a huge part of Phase0 so far, and I can honestly say I've enjoyed it a lot, especally considering that I shared [at least in some part] the same preconceived notions as everyone else.<br><br>

						The hardest part of pairing for me is dealing with others who have a skill level noticeably greater or less than my own. I'll make clear here that this feeling isn't due to insecurity, in the case of the former, or condescension, in the case of the latter, but rather because of logistics: it's impossible not to notice when someone's going too fast or slow, and its awkward to confront either, regardless of the environment. I started with a negative so I could get it out of the way, because, as I've already mentioned, I've really enjoyed it. Outside of coding, my favorite part of pairing is meeting new people. I've gotten to know, at least in some small way, a number of people through pair sessions that I've really enjoyed talking to - people who have similar interests and goals and who are sharing in a common experience. Talking to other people and finding out they have the same concerns or thoughts helps to break the isolation implicit in any home-learning or autodidactic pursuit. Pairing has also been important to the progress I've made learning code. When I code alone, I tend to take a long time to finish a problem; its very easy to start down a dead end path or spend hours looking online for a way to solve something when you're not entirely sure what to do. Coding in a pair allows me to talk through strategy for a problem and have someone there to check my logic or the thought's viability, and vis-a-versa. This co-strategizing has been what has benefited me the most from a logistical standpoint, since 2 people have twice the experience, and each can help fill the gap in knowledge the other might have. <br><br>

						Feedback has been an interesting thing to have during Phase0, and I've generally been happy with it. Regardless of your mindset, learning style, or anything, its hard not feel a little upset when reading critical feedback. And there's nothing wrong with that. How you respond to the feedback internally after your initial emotional reaction is what's really important, and its counterproductive to try and ignore how you feel. I've received what I consider positive feedback from both pairing sessions and GPS instructors, in addition to some critical (I won't say negative, since this would be inaccurate) feedback as well. For good or for bad, I usually focus on the critical feedback - it may seem like a depressing statement, but, hey, why spend most of the time focusing on what you can already do? One example of this was regarding my easy-going pairing style: that is, I was regarded as not being assertive enough in pairing sessions when I had an idea or something to say. While I was a bit surprised by this feedback, it was said twice close to the beginning of Phase0, so I consciously made an effort to speak out more clearly and forcefully during pairing sessions. I always considered my demeanor to be polite, but I'm glad that people brought their view of things to my attention, since how one comes off to others when working in groups is so important for work flow. I have, since trying to change how I act, begun to worry that I will eventually become too forceful, and in turn face a whole new set of criticism, and I've been trying hard to focus on maintaining a balance and making sure I stay in the middle.</p>
