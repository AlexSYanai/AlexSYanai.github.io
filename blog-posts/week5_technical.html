						<p>Ruby is a powerful programming language which, due to its focus on productivity and good user interface, is also relatively accessible to beginners. Ruby  is an object-oriented programming language: almost everything in Ruby -  Integers, Strings, Arrays, Hashes - is an object that can understand specific messages. A message sent to an object corresponds to a method, a routine that the object can initiate, allowing objects to store data, interact with each other, or perform any number of complicated actions.<br><br>

						But how do objects 'know' what they can or can't do? Where are the rules? What makes one different from the other? To answer these questions, you have to understand Classes.<br><br>

						A Class is a group of behaviors or attributes defined by a programmer. Every object is a part of a Class, referred to as being an 'instance' of a Class, and objects can only be instances of one Class. Ruby comes with a number of built-in Classes - such as 'String' - but what makes Classes so useful is the ability to define your own. Classes can, in turn, have sub-Classes that have their own properties, in addition to inheriting the properties of the parent Class.<br><br>

						This all probably seem complicated, but it's in many ways similar to how we think of things in our daily life. Imagine you're at a friend's place and you decide to go to dinner; you don't know what you want, so you start throwing out names:<br><br>


						<p class="block">class Restaurant<br>
						&#160;&#160;def initialize(name, distance, cuisine)<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;@name = name<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;@distance = distance<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;@cuisine = cuisine<br>
						&#160;&#160;end<br><br>

						&#160;&#160;def decisions<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "How about #{@name}?"<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "Its about #{@distance} away."<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "Are you in the mood for #{@cuisine}?"<br>
						&#160;&#160;end<br><br>

						&#160;&#160;def style<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;dinner<br>
						&#160;&#160;end<br>
						end</p>

						You decide you want to go to a place that will serve food (Restaurant) and base your decision on a variety of factors common to all Restaurants: How far away is it? What food does it serve? Have I heard of it? In Ruby, this information is set in the 'initialize method' as instance variables, each of which is available to the rest of the methods in the class and differs for each instance of that class. Just as you might go over each factor for each restaurant, we can do the same in Ruby by creating instances of this Class for each restaurant:<br><br>

						<p class="block">mcdonalds = Restaurant.new("McDonald's", "1 Mile", "Burgers")<br>
						shakeshack = Restaurant.new("Shake Shack", "2 Miles", "Burgers")<br>
						umami = Restaurant.new("Umami Burger", "1 Mile", "Burgers")</p><br>

						This Class allows us to group together a number of Restaurants with similar attributes: all Restaurants have a name, are a certain distance away, and serve a specific type of food. Still Restaurant is a broad category; these 4 instances of Restaurant have a few things in common, but they can also be divided further:<br><br>

						<p class="block">class Fastfood < Restaurant<br>
						&#160;&#160;def style<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "It's cheap."<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "We can bring it back here."<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "We definitely have time to go there."<br>
						&#160;&#160;end<br>
						end<br><br>

						class Fastcasual < Restaurant<br>
						&#160;&#160;def style<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "Its not too expensive."<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "We can bring it back here or eat there if you want."<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "They're pretty fast, but the line might be long."<br>
						&#160;&#160;end<br>
						end<br><br>

						class Sitdown < Restaurant<br>
						&#160;&#160;def style<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "It's a bit expensive, but you can find something cheap."<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "Do you want to sit down somewhere?"<br>
						&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;puts "How much time do you have? There might be a wait."<br>
						&#160;&#160;end<br>
						end</p><br>

						In this way, we can further differetiate objects that still share common attributes with all other objects. McDonald's and Umami Burger aren't much alike, but you can get a hamburger at both. If we want to figure out if we want to go to, say, Chipotle instead:<br><br>

						<p class="block">chipotle = Fastcasual.new("Chipotle", "half a mile", "Mexican")<br>
						jomthong.decisions<br>
						=>"How about Chipotle?"<br>
						&#160;&#160;"Its about half a mile away."<br>
						&#160;&#160;"Are you in the mood for Mexican?"<br><br>

						chipotle.style<br>
						=>"Its not too expensive."<br>
						&#160;&#160;"We can bring it back here or eat there if you want."<br>
						&#160;&#160;"They're pretty fast, but the line might be long."<br></p>
