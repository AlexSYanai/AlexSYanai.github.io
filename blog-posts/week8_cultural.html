						<p>Dealing with conflict is something that everyone has to go develop on their own; after all, for all of the strategies or 'tools' that can be taught in order to do so more effectively, doing so is inherently emotional, meaning that higher-level cognition or reasoning could be relegated to a back seat role in favor of pure emotion.<br><br>

						One of the most recent and recurring conflicts I've had to deal with is over 'what I'm doing', as so many have put it. It's often not easy to explain to people the choices you make, since they lack your experiences or frames of reference and substitute in their own, but when people repeatedly point out that I'm not working or haven't 'been doing anything', it's kind of hard to not get at least annoyed. Or worse.<br><br>

						When the most recent peson to do this, a friend, decided to bring this up, it was one too many times, and I was really not in the mood to hear it. I wouldn't say that I reacted with intense anger, but I was a lot more overtly angry than I normally would be; after all, while they only knew that I was sitting at home all day, not going anywhere or taking the time to see people as often as I used to, I knew that I was spending that time working through challenges and reading hundreds of pages of material.<br><br>

						In retrospect, I know I should have explained all of this. Saying that I should have taken more time to explain is easy, but in reality, I can understand why I acted the way I did. I've generally been pretty good at not taking it personally when people don't understand my decisions, but occasionally it's too much, and anger gets the better of me. Still, I think I was able to moderate my reaction to an understandable degree, and have since spoken to the same friend (though not about that conversation) and have gotten along well with him.<br><br>
