## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a repository (repo) on GitHub is easy! Start by going to, logically enough, the 'new repository' page (https://github.com/new). Once on the page, creating a repository is as simple as typing its name in the box, deciding whether or not to share it publicly or include a license, and hitting 'create repository.' Simple, right? Cloning a repo is a little more complicated, but its not too bad. Navigate to your newly created repo and look towards the bottom, right-hand portion of the screen for a box labeled 'SSH clone URL' (or HTTPS clone URL); just copy the link and...you're done! Ok, not quite. This link tells git (I'll assume you already have git installed, and if not, this should be done ASAP) the location of the repo to clone, but we'll need to go to the console to do this. On Windows, hit Windows+R (or Windows+Q) and type and click on 'powershell.' You can use the command line like you use folders, only without the pictures - from here, you can navigate to where you want the repo to be stored on your computer. When you're there, type 'git clone [URL]' and git does the rest!

Open Source refers to software that has its source code - the code the developers wrote to make it - publicly available for others to download and modify.

Overall, I really like the idea of open source. When something is restricted it benefits a small group of people and cannot change as quickly or responsively; while this is not necessarily a bad thing in general, with regards to computers, at a time where everything else in technology is changing rapidly, it makes sense that software and coding should keep up. Having so many people willing to devote time and energy to development in order to fit their needs and desires is a boon to web development and the internet as a whole. As somebody looking to enter the field of web development (in a paid way, that is), its hard for me not to be somewhat apprehensive of how open-source code will affect me personally, but objectively I see it as a good thing.

###
A license is a kind of middle ground between keeping source code private and just releasing it openly. A license does not mean that the work is suddenly everyone's property; a license holder retains whatever original copyright they have on the work and, importantly, acknowledged authorship of the work while still allowing others to study and edit it. What users can and cannot do with a person's licensed work depends on the license that they use.

###
The logistical part of this challenge was fairly straight forward and wasn't too complicated affter completing the previous challenge. My small 'aha' moment came with regards to licenses; I never really understood what rights license holders have (ie: why need a license for freely releasing work?) but reading about the specifics of some of the different kinds of licenses illuminated this for me.

I did not use any outside resources for this challenge!
