  <div class="reflection">
    With the changing browser landscape, thinking past static design towards fluid or responsive deisng has never been more important. Mobile users, according to recent usage-share data, account for 20-25% of browser traffic on the internet, a number that's increased from virtually nothing over the past 6 years; so many people are accessing web pages from mobile devices, at one time or another, that developers must be conscious of how their work will appear across a range of screen sizes. <br>

    Fluid Design is one way in which developers can make their sites adjust to varying screen sizes. While a static web page generally has its dimensions defined in pixels, a page utilizing fluid design sets its dimensions using percentages. The advantage of using percentages to set proportions are clear; setting a page's proportions with percentages will cause it to retain its general layout, regardless of the size of the screen being used. While a static site designed for a small screen may generate large blank spaces or unreadable content on large screens, a fluid site will expand to fit. <br>

    Developing a site using fluid design does have a number of advantages, but it also has some major shortcomings today. A site developed mainly for desktop browsing may work for a wide range of screens, but certain features or content might not display properly on smaller screens - after all, 5% of a desktop monitor is a lot different than 5% of an iPhone. Developers today often design their sites using responsive design, a method that adjusts the page layout based on the size of the screen or type of device accessing it. To design responsive web pages, developers use CSS Media Queries to present (often significantly) different layouts depending on screen parameters. A web page fully utilizing responsive design can have several different layouts to present, often being set or optimized for the most common desktop and mobile screen dimensions. While the content almost always stays the same, certain elements may be rearranged on the page, and certain features may be moved or removed entirely.
