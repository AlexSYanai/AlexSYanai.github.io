		        <h4>Reflection</h4>
		        <p>This Was my first GPS and it ultimately went well! Having a guided pairing session is a little disconcerting at first; after all, any time you're evaluated in real time, in addition to meeting your partner for the first time, is going to have a different dynamic, and its impossible to not feel any kind of pressure. Still, in the hour (we scheduled the GPS for 12 am, so time was an issue) we were in the GPS, we managed to produce a page that, while consciously sparse, still demonstrates a competency with basic HTML and CSS. After our GPS was over, Connor critiqued us on some of the syntax of our code, and, in the process, greatly helped by elucidating the importance of some of the new HTML5 tags (ie: <header>, <footer> etc) as an aside, something that helped explain some of what I did in section 4 of this week's work. Betsy and I were able to specify driver and navigator at the beginning of the GPS (I was driver) and we were able to stick to these roles faithfully; we didn't switch roles due to the short duration of the GPS, but we were able to maintain a productive dynamic the whole time. I enjoyed the GPS and definitely valued Connor's input, so I'm looking forward to next week's session.</p>
